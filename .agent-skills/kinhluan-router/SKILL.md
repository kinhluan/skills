## 0. Agent Charter — Expertise & Authority

### 0.1 Agent Identity

When activated, the agent **must** declare its expertise domain and current role:

```
"I am acting as a [Domain Expert] in [Specific Field]. 
 My objective is to [Task Goal] using the [Skill Name] framework.
 I will follow the Master Framework's [Layer X] workflow."
```

### 0.2 User Sovereignty — The Golden Rule

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AGENT PROPOSES  →  USER DECIDES  →  AGENT EXECUTES         │
│                                                             │
│  • Agent NEVER makes irreversible decisions without consent │
│  • Agent ALWAYS presents trade-offs, not ultimatums         │
│  • User can OVERRIDE any recommendation at any time         │
│  • Agent must CONFIRM before: skip steps, change scope,     │
│    deviate from Master Framework                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Mandatory escalation points:**
- Skip a workflow stage → Ask user: "Bước [X] chưa hoàn thành. Bạn có muốn bỏ qua không?"
- Change JTBD/Value Prop after PMR → Ask user: "PMR kết quả [X]. Có cập nhật JTBD không?"
- Override kill criteria → Ask user: "Kill criteria triggered: [reason]. Proceed anyway?"
- Select tech stack → Ask user: "Recommend [stack]. Approve or choose alternative?"

### 0.3 Master Framework Compliance

**Before ANY recommendation, agent must check:**

```
□ 1. What workflow stage is the user in? (PhD / MVP / Ngũ Sự / Tech)
□ 2. What artifacts already exist in workspace?
□ 3. What is the NEXT required step per Master Framework?
□ 4. Does user's request match the current stage?
□ 5. If NOT match → Escalate: "Bạn đang ở bước [X]. 
    Muốn làm [Y] trước, hay hoàn thành [X] trước?"
```

**Compliance violation examples:**
| User Request | Current Stage | Agent Response |
|---|---|---|
| "Viết code ngay" | Chưa có JTBD | "Cần define JTBD trước. Dùng business-product-leadership?" |
| "Deploy production" | Chưa có CI/CD | "Cần setup pipeline trước. Dùng collaborative-engineering-agent?" |
| "Viết paper" | Chưa có experiment | "Cần chạy experiment trước. Dùng experiment-tracking?" |
| "Refactor architecture" | Chưa có C4 L1 | "Cần vẽ C4 L1 trước. Dùng c4-level1-context?" |

---

## 1. When to Use

- User says: "dùng skill phù hợp", "use right skill", "kinhluan skills", "what should I do next?"
- Multiple skills could apply to a request
- Unclear which workflow stage the user is in
- Need to check artifact existence before routing
- Cross-workflow routing (e.g., "write paper" but experiments not done yet)

---

## 2. Routing Architecture

### 2.1 Three-Layer Detection

```
Layer 1: WORKFLOW DETECTION
    ├─ PhD/Research workflow?
    ├─ MVP/Product workflow?
    ├─ Ngũ Sự/Strategy audit?
    └─ Pure tech/dev task?

Layer 2: STAGE / ARTIFACT DETECTION
    ├─ What files exist in workspace?
    ├─ What was the last completed step?
    └─ What gaps exist in the current workflow?

Layer 3: INTENT CLASSIFICATION
    ├─ Create / Write / Review / Analyze / Fix
    ├─ Specific domain (scheduling, FL, security...)
    └─ Urgency / priority signals
```

### 2.2 Workflow Detection Rules

| User Signal | Likely Workflow | Check For |
|---|---|---|
| "paper", "thesis", "experiment", "baseline", "survey" | **PhD/Research** | `research/` dir, `sota-matrix.md`, `experiments/` |
| "MVP", "product", "feature", "launch", "JTBD", "user" | **MVP/Product** | `docs/why-statement.md`, `c4-diagrams/`, feature flags |
| "should we build", "competitor", "strategy", "timing" | **Ngũ Sự/Strategy** | No specific artifacts — always available |
| "code", "review", "bug", "API", "database", "test" | **Tech/Dev** | Source code files, `package.json`, `go.mod`, etc. |

## 3. PhD/Research Workflow Routing

### Stage Map

```
Stage 0: START ──→ sota-survey (if no sota-matrix.md)
   │
Stage 1: SURVEY ──→ research-question (if sota-matrix.md exists, no RQ defined)
   │
Stage 2: RQ ──→ research-design (if RQ exists, no protocol)
   │
Stage 3: DESIGN ──→ experiment-tracking (if protocol exists, no experiments run)
   │
Stage 4: EXPERIMENT ──→ paper-writing (if results exist, no draft)
   │
Stage 5: DRAFT ──→ internal-critique → journal-q1-polish (if draft exists)
   │
Stage 6: POLISH ──→ publication-strategy (if paper ready)
   │
Stage 7: SUBMIT ──→ defense-prep (if paper accepted / thesis compilation)
```

### Artifact-Based Routing

| Artifact Exists? | Missing? | Route To |
|---|---|---|
| No `sota-matrix.md` | — | `sota-survey` |
| `sota-matrix.md` | No clear RQ | `research-question` |
| `sota-matrix.md` + RQ | No experiment protocol | `research-design` |
| Protocol | No `experiments/` dir or logs | `experiment-tracking` |
| Experiment logs | No paper draft | `paper-writing` |
| Paper draft | Not self-reviewed | `internal-critique` |
| Self-reviewed draft | Not polished for Q1 | `journal-q1-polish` |
| Polished paper | No venue selected | `publication-strategy` |
| Accepted papers | No defense prep | `defense-prep` |

### Cross-Stage Routing Examples

**User: "viết paper về federated learning"**
```
1. Detect: PhD workflow
2. Check: Does sota-matrix.md exist? → No
3. Route: "Bạn cần survey SOTA trước. Dùng sota-survey để tìm papers, 
   sau đó mới viết paper."
```

**User: "review my paper"**
```
1. Detect: PhD workflow, Stage 5-6
2. Check: Does draft exist? → Yes
3. Check: Has internal-critique been run? → No
4. Route: internal-critique
5. After critique: "Tiếp theo dùng journal-q1-polish để chuẩn hóa Q1."
```

**User: "so sánh baseline"**
```
1. Detect: PhD workflow, Stage 4
2. Check: experiments/ exists? → Yes
3. Route: experiment-tracking (comparison workflow)
```

---

## 4. MVP/Product Workflow Routing

### Stage Map

```
Stage 0: START ──→ problem-discovery (if no problem statement)
   │
Stage 1: DISCOVERY ──→ why-strategic-rationale (if problem validated)
   │
Stage 2: WHY ──→ business-product-leadership (if WHY statement exists)
   │
Stage 3: WHAT ──→ ddd-core + c4-model (if JTBD defined)
   │
Stage 4: DESIGN ──→ ddd-tactical + c4-level2/3 (if bounded contexts defined)
   │
Stage 5: BUILD ──→ python-dev / js-dev / go-dev (if architecture ready)
   │
Stage 6: SHIP ──→ docker + k8s + dora-core + collaborative-engineering-agent
   │
Stage 7: RELEASE ──→ diffusion-release-tracking
```

### Artifact-Based Routing

| Artifact Exists? | Missing? | Route To |
|---|---|---|
| No problem validation | — | `problem-discovery` |
| Problem statement | No WHY statement | `why-strategic-rationale` |
| WHY statement | No JTBD | `business-product-leadership` |
| JTBD | No architecture | `ddd-core` + `c4-model` |
| C4 L1/L2 | No component design | `ddd-tactical` + `c4-level3-component` |
| Architecture | No code | `python-dev` / `js-dev` / `go-dev` |
| Code | No CI/CD | `collaborative-engineering-agent` + `docker` |
| CI/CD | No release plan | `diffusion-release-tracking` |

### Ngũ Sự Audit Routing

At any stage, user can trigger Ngũ Sự assessment:

```
User: "đánh giá lại chiến lược" / "should we continue?"
→ art-of-war-software-engineering (score all 5 factors)
   ├─ Tao < 5 → why-strategic-rationale
   ├─ Heaven < 5 → problem-discovery + diffusion-release-tracking
   ├─ Earth < 5 → c4-model audit
   ├─ Command < 5 → business-product-leadership (DRI/RACI)
   └─ Method < 5 → dora-core baseline
```

---

## 5. Tech/Dev Task Routing

### Language Detection

| File Pattern | Language | Route To |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json`, `.tsx`, `.ts` | JavaScript/TypeScript | `javascript-typescript` |
| `go.mod`, `.go` | Go | `golang-development` |
| `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.py` | Python | `python-development` |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | Docker | `docker-containerization` |
| `*.yaml` in `k8s/`, `deployment.yml` | Kubernetes | `kubernetes-orchestration` |

### Task Type Detection

| User Intent | Route To |
|---|---|
| "review code", "code review", "critique" | `collaborative-engineering-agent` (DRE) |
| "security", "vulnerability", "OWASP" | `security-analysis` |
| "pentest", "exploit", "khai thác", "burp", "metasploit", "nmap", "sqlmap" | `penetration-testing` |
| "threat model", "stride", "attack tree", "security design" | `threat-modeling` |
| "aws security", "gcp security", "cloud security", "iam", "compliance" | `cloud-security` |
| "docker security", "k8s security", "container hardening", "falco" | `container-security` |
| "api security", "oauth", "api gateway", "graphql security" | `api-security` |
| "architecture", "design", "refactor" | `c4-model` + `ddd-core` |
| "test", "testing", "bug" | `collaborative-engineering-agent` + language skill |
| "deploy", "CI/CD", "pipeline" | `dora-core` + `collaborative-engineering-agent` |
| "ADR", "decision" | `architecture-decision-records` |

---

## 6. Domain-Specific Routing

These skills are **domain-specific** and only route when the domain is explicitly mentioned:

| Domain Mentioned | Route To |
|---|---|
| "federated learning", "FL", "DQN", "privacy" | `federated-learning-dqn` |
| "scheduling", "HEFT", "GA", "makespan" | `scheduling-algorithms` |

**Rule:** Do NOT route to domain-specific skills unless the user explicitly mentions the domain or the workspace contains domain-specific code (e.g., `federated/`, `scheduling/` directories).

---

```
1. Workflow: Tech/Dev
2. Language: Go (go.mod detected)
3. Intent: code review
4. Route:
   a. golang-development (language patterns)
   b. collaborative-engineering-agent (DRE critique)
   c. security-analysis (if auth/API involved)
```
